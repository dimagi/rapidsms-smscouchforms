Couch-based XForm storage for RapidSMS.

Let's you combine interactive SMS form sessions with couchdb storage for 
data saving and export.

Dependencies:

rapidsms-smsforms: https://github.com/dimagi/rapidsms-smsforms
 - touchforms: https://github.com/dimagi/touchforms
couchforms: https://github.com/dimagi/couchforms
couchexport: https://github.com/dimagi/couchexport
 - django-soil: https://github.com/dimagi/django-soil



Also you must have the following line(s) in your settings.py 
(update to match your configuration, and use a real dbname)

COUCH_DATABASE = "http://localhost:5984/[dbname]"
XFORMS_POST_URL = "%s/_design/couchforms/_update/xform/" % COUCH_DATABASE

Also make sure you have the following in your INSTALLED_APPS:

INSTALLED_APPS = [
    # all your other apps go here
    ... 
    "couchforms",
    "couchexport",
    "smsforms",
    "smscouchforms",
    "touchforms"
]

And in your COUCHDB_APPS:

COUCHDB_APPS = [
    # all your other couchdb apps go here
    ... 
    'couchforms', 
    'couchexport'
]


Finally, make sure you include the following in your site's urls.py

urlpatterns = patterns('',
    # all your other urls 
    ... 
    (r'^smsforms/', include('smsforms.urls')),
    (r'^smscouchforms/', include('smscouchforms.urls')),
    (r'^couchexport/', include("couchexport.urls"))
